        <p>
          Hi, my name is Abhin, a software engineer who loves a good challenge.
          In the past, I've had the opportunity to develop software across a
          variety of settings — from an innovative EdTech platform, or a
          creative MedTech solution, to just as a freelance agent for startups
          trying to find their feet making it big. Additionally, I also
          volunteer my time and engineering skills to help organisations fight
          the climate change battle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dreaming up cool automative yet productivity and user-first ideas and
          making them come true is where my passion lies. I started programming
          in 2017, and made it my career in 2021. My roles have spanned the
          entire stack, from frontend to backend, and from AI to DevOps, and I
          have enjoyed almost every minute of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my spare time, I'm usually at the gym, climbing, enjoying cricket,
          researching new places to eat at or planning my next travel.

          What I appreciate most about Abhin is his commitment. He's not just

          make a real impact.
