            Hi, my name is Abhin, a software engineer who loves a good challenge. In the past, I've had the opportunity to develop software across a variety of settings — from an innovative EdTech platform, or a creative MedTech solution, to just as a freelance agent for startups trying to find their feet making it big. Additionally, I also volunteer my time and engineering skills to help organisations fight the climate change battle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dreaming up cool automative yet productivity and user-first ideas and making them come true is where my passion lies. I started programming in 2017, and made it my career in 2021. My roles have spanned the entire stack, from frontend to backend, and from AI to DevOps, and I have enjoyed almost every minute of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my spare time, I'm usually at the gym, climbing, enjoying cricket, researching new places to eat at or planning my next travel.
