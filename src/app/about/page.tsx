          I was born and raised in New Delhi. Currently I reside in Melbourne,
          Australia. Prior to moving to Melbourne in 2023, I worked with various
          small and mid-size teams as a software engineer. I have worked at
          Openhouse, ReWorld Earth, Wetlands International, Virtetic, and more.

          I migrated to Melbourne to study a Masters of IT, and specialize in
          Artificial Intelligence. I completed a Bachelor of Science in
          Statistics from University of Delhi before this, sharpening my
          analytical and critical skills.

          When I'm not working, you can usually find me reading up on variety of
          things (astrophysics, cricket, finance, âˆž), going for hikes, or
          photographing natural landscapes.
