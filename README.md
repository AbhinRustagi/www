## Content

- **Local**: localised content such as metadata, timeline and other is sourced from the [content](/src/content) folder.
- **Blog**: fetched from my [blog](https://www.github.com/AbhinRustagi/blog) repository, which is the root for all posts for this website and publishing on different platforms. On each post published, the website is re-built and deployed via Vercel webhooks.
- **Projects**: sourced from my source-of-truth [projects](https://www.github.com/AbhinRustagi/projects) repository. On each project added, the website is re-built and deployed via Vercel webhooks.
